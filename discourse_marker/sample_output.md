This is an example of LLM inference based on our function:

```
Discourse Analysis:
                    {
                      'markers of emotional engagement':
                                                          ['Hey', 'right?'],
                      'markers of directive intent':
                                                          ['click that share link', 'I will give you $5,000'],
                      'ethical and formal discourse markers':
                                                          ["As some of you may know, I'm Bill Gates", 'I always deliver', 'I mean, I brought you Windows XP'],
                      'markers of problematic credibility':
                                                          ['I will give you $5,000', 'I always deliver', 'I mean, I brought you Windows XP'],
                      'markers of cohesion':
